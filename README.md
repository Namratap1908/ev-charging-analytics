## 🚀 Future Work
- Launch and host Streamlit dashboard online
- Add filters for charger types (Level 1, Level 2, DC Fast)
- Correlate EV station density with population data

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python:** pandas, plotly, matplotlib
- **Streamlit:** interactive dashboard (upcoming)
- **Tableau Public:** visual storytelling and drill-down
- **Jupyter Notebook + HTML export**
- **GitHub:** version control and collaboration
